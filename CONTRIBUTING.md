## Contribution Guidelines

Bug reports and feature requests are always appriciated, but please keep these things in mind:

- Make sure that a similar issue hasn't already been raised.
- When submitting bugs, please include detailed steps on how to reproduce.

If you'd like to contribute code, please follow these simple steps:

- Select an unassigned issue labeled 'help-wanted', or
- If you want to submit new code without an associated issue, submit an issue first. Make sure the feature or bugfix is wanted before doing any work. Nothing is more frustrating than writing code that will not be accepted.
- Comment on the issue that you are working on it.
- Fork this repo (if you haven't already) and do all your work in a new branch.
- Submit your work as a pull request.
